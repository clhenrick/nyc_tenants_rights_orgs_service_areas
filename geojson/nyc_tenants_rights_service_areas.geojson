neighborhood preservation services; housing assistance; energy affordability analyses and retrofits; health & safety improvements; and client education and housing counseling to low to moderate income tenants, homeowners, the elderly, and persons with disabilities. While our primary service area is Far Rockaway, Queens, we also provide vital housing services to all of Queens County and the entire NYC Metro Area. These services are provided by leveraging a variety of public and private funds primarily designed to assist households at or below 90% of our area's medium income and/or in severe financial distress. These sources, leveraged through the core administrative budget provided by the NYS DHCR Neighborhood Preservation Program, include: the DHCR Energy Services Bureau Weatherization Assistance Program, the HTFC RESTORE Program LPA, the HTFC HOME Program LPA, the HTFC Access to Home Program LPA, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Housing Counseling Program, the NYC DFTA Last Resort and coordinated weatherization programs, the Long Island Fuel Fund's Project Warmth, new construction applications through the NYS DHCR Unified Funding Process, and NYSERDA funded energy efficiency programs. We also provide housing counseling services through the New York Mortgage Coalition and NYC HPD City Council Initiative programs, and first time home ownership opportunities through community

became increasingly aware that the viability of the Ditmars Boulevard-31st Street commercial strip was essential to the continued well-being of the entire neighborhood.  As the commercial revitalization activities of the Astoria Restoration Association continued, which included the completion of a 1.7 million dollar physical improvement project for the area, it soon became apparent that housing deterioration had to be addressed before it developed into a more serious problem.  Thus in 1981, the ARA began a comprehensive housing and neighborhood revitalization program aimed at strengthening the existing housing stock of the neighborhood.

peninsula","origin_dat":"pediacities","borough":"QN","description":"Rockaway Development and Revitalization Corporation is a not-for-profit economic development organization serving the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens, NY. Our mission is to improve the quality of life within the community through the following divisions: business, housing, employment and training, and Youth Services-Beacon Program. The business division primarily focuses upon the recruitment and retention of businesses within the NYS Economic Development Zone (EDZ). Certain types of businesses that open within the EDZ are entitled to tax breaks, attractive financing packages, and discounts on utility expenses. Businesses already in the EDZ that are currently expanding are entitled to similar financial benefits. The housing division is engaged in the creation of rental and owner-occupied housing, improvement to the existing housing stock, the education of potential first-time homeowners, and financial assistance and counseling to homeowners and renters. The division is currently involved with acquiring vacant land and developing it into two-family homes that will be sold at prices affordable to households earning 80% of median area income or less. The Housing Division also educates and packages loans for individuals interested in purchasing, refinancing, and building residential housing in the area. The employment and training division trains, prepares, and places individuals seeking employment. This is done through the Youth Employment Program, which places 14 to 18 year olds. The S.T.R.I.V.E. program prepares adults who have been unsuccessful in holding onto gainful employment by addressing attitudes and providing  basic skills.

physical disabilities,  and developmentally disabled adults.  Project S.H.A.R.E. (Senior Housing at Reduced Expense) has provided safe and affordable shared housing opportunities for over 28 years for low-income seniors and disabled persons.  This program includes both agency-managed apartments in which three to four persons live cooperatively  in a residence maintained by Richmond Senior Services, and housing in the homes of senior homeowners who are willing to share their homes for the benefits of companionship and financial contribution to the household.  Both these opportunities are viable options in the ever-increasing costs of the rental market.  The Access to Home program provides home modifications  to low-income disabled persons to allow them safe access in, out and throughout their homes.  The addition of ramps, lifts, visual acuity and other modifications assures their full access to their community and needed services, and helps them to remain at home rather than in an institution.  The Senior Repair Program is a  home repair service that offers minor health and safety related home repairs for seniors and disabled persons.  This program covers the small, but otherwise costly, repairs that seniors cannot complete themselves due to lack of income or physical capabilities.    Hundreds of repairs are completed each year.  Our advocacy, information and referral,  entitlement counseling and application assistance also assist seniors and disabled persons in maintaining their independence in the community by accessing all possible services, including housing, adult education, emergency food supplies, and other housing repair services.  A senior food pantry provides emergency food to seniors and disabled persons each month who are experiencing difficulty in meeting household expenses.  Recipients of the food supplies also receive pre-screening for food stamps, entitlement screenings, housing and  job counseling, case assistance and information and referral.  The program encourages a nutritionally sound diet, while also alleviating some demands upon their financial resources.","email":"rss500@con2.com","full_address":"729 Delafield Ave Staten Island, Ny 10310","name":"Richmond Senior Services, Inc.","org_id":127,"phone":"(718) 816-1811","service_area":"North Shore","website_url":"","cartodb_id":17,"created_at":"2015-04-20T01:20:06Z","updated_at":"2015-04-20T01:20:06Z"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-73.93383,40.819521],[-73.93383,40.819521],[-73.933829,40.815586],[-73.933945,40.815588],[-73.933945,40.815588],[-73.933946,40.815588],[-73.934015,40.814484],[-73.933857,40.814482],[-73.933865,40.814154],[-73.934339,40.809563],[-73.934121,40.808657],[-73.933561,40.807601],[-73.93116,40.804967],[-73.930309,40.803787],[-73.929208,40.801148],[-73.929035,40.801081],[-73.928902,40.799856],[-73.929037,40.796763],[-73.929279,40.795854],[-73.929875,40.795036],[-73.929843,40.795016],[-73.929852,40.795002],[-73.92981,40.794984],[-73.929833,40.79495],[-73.929888,40.794968],[-73.929902,40.794947],[-73.929916,40.79495],[-73.929937,40.794919],[-73.929921,40.79491],[-73.930069,40.794701],[-73.930108,40.794714],[-73.930197,40.794594],[-73.933485,40.792775],[-73.935265,40.791526],[-73.935191,40.791472],[-73.935468,40.791264],[-73.935539,40.791319],[-73.935831,40.791095],[-73.937062,40.789414],[-73.937053,40.789407],[-73.937081,40.789367],[-73.937073,40.789346],[-73.936141,40.78895],[-73.936129,40.788939],[-73.936127,40.788927],[-73.936219,40.788801],[-73.936228,40.788796],[-73.936243,40.788797],[-73.936883,40.78906],[-73.936946,40.789086],[-73.937148,40.789169],[-73.937149,40.789168],[-73.93715,40.789169],[-73.937774,40.787784],[-73.938116,40.787185],[-73.939826,40.785257],[-73.942435,40.783918],[-73.94324,40.783328],[-73.943593,40.782748],[-73.944023,40.782961],[-73.955761,40.787907],[-73.949695,40.796218],[-73.9494,40.796638],[-73.949552,40.796694],[-73.949641,40.796804],[-73.949657,40.797069],[-73.949374,40.797158],[-73.949228,40.797149],[-73.949073,40.797095],[-73.944597,40.803229],[-73.942993,40.802562],[-73.941166,40.805064],[-73.942754,40.805745],[-73.933992,40.817786],[-73.934289,40.81957],[-73.93383,40.819521]]]]},"properties":{"area":"east harlem","origin_dat":"pediacities","borough":"MN","description":"116th STREET BLOCK ASSOCIATION, INC. is a nonprofit community based organization located in East Harlem and serving residents of Community Board 11.  The association was organized in 1976 and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York in 1979 by a group of community leaders who were concerned about the negative effects of crime, drugs, lack of employment opportunities, abandonment, poor quality of housing, and bank disinvestment in the area. The Association was created with the view of collaborating in a recuperating strategy for the community; aspiring to develop tenants potential through meaningful workshops in leadership; to organize tenants; secure housing from negligent landlords; promote neighborhood stability; and provide low-income housing. The services and activities are based upon the conviction that in order to effectively control housing problems, the neighborhood residents themselves must become involved. The Association promotes a self-help approach in attending other needs arising from poverty levels characterizing vast sectors of the community. The examination of the issues of the community and the individual person in a holistic way has led to a web of interrelations with other community organizations in order to improve the quality assistance offered to housing, schools, churches, hospitals, police, fire departments and other service providers in the area. The organizational relationship avoids repetitive efforts and economic redundancy. The Association provides independent living skills workshops to the community on various topics such as: Lead Awareness-Local Law 1, management, crime prevention (trespassing program), arson awareness, the operation of tenants associations and health issues.  Through NYC HPD's  Anti-Abandonment Unit- Community Consultant Program, the association offers walk-in services for: case management, counseling services, tenant counseling on apartment maintenance, referrals to suitable housing, employment and education, assistance with applications for Public Housing, Section 8 and Public Assistance, rent arrears application, DRIE (Disability Rent Increase Exempt), Con Edison /Heartshare (grant for individuals who are in distress and in arrears with electrical/gas bill, this program is seasonal), and protecting their legal rights. The association's most recent contract with NYC HPD's Anti-Abandonment Unit as an NPC provides surveys to buildings in housing code violations; assists landlords to get into voluntary repair agreements, repair loans, building maintenance and other programs to be eligible for tax breaks; mediation with both landlord and tenant dispossession and evictions; technical assistance to residents of city owned buildings; and management and financial services assistance to buildings already converted to Cooperatives. Services are provided to Seniors to motivate them to secure and maintain entitlement benefits and assist with their physical, psychological and social well being. The organization assists with various programs accessible for seniors such as referral to suitable housing placement, SCRIE, HEAP, IT210 & IT214 tax rebates, Medicare/Medicaid, Home care referral and social cultural/ recreational programs.","email":"candy10029@aol.com","full_address":"55 E 115th St New York, Ny 10029","name":"116 Street Block Association, Inc.","org_id":92,"phone":"(212)

According to the 1990 census, incomes tend to be low - often below poverty levels.  Housing is mostly old (circa 1900 - 1930) and at a premium. CHJCC administers programs, advocates for clients, and provides referrals on issues of housing, employment, economic development, entitlements, problems of the aging, aid to crime victims, assistance for indigent residents. CHJCC has created multi-racial, faith, and community-based programs such as Project Care, which unites civic and religious leaders from every segment of the community in a funded program to promote efforts in social and economic development. Creative initiatives such as Project Care have addressed areas of common concern, and new avenues of communication and cooperation have emerged. One of the major goals of the CHJCC is to promote an atmosphere of understanding and cooperation in the community.  Areas of common concern, including housing, poverty, crime, employment, education and economic development, are being addressed through new programs.","email":"ecohen@chjcc.org","full_address":"392 Kingston Ave Brooklyn, Ny 11225","name":"Crown Heights Jewish Community Council, Inc.","org_id":75,"phone":"(718) 771-9000","service_area":"Crown Heights","website_url":"http://www.chcentral.org","cartodb_id":27,"created_at":"2015-04-20T01:20:06Z","updated_at":"2015-04-20T01:20:06Z"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-73.905821,40.694114],[-73.90158,40.691767],[-73.904773,40.688318],[-73.905495,40.686883],[-73.904581,40.686425],[-73.903684,40.68521],[-73.904054,40.684971],[-73.904183,40.685427],[-73.904739,40.68563],[-73.905714,40.6841],[-73.902754,40.682415],[-73.902642,40.680704],[-73.904052,40.681466],[-73.905479,40.68004],[-73.941149,40.700282],[-73.94042,40.701078],[-73.933951,40.702675],[-73.92598,40.705793],[-73.921676,40.709472],[-73.91198,40.703604],[-73.91202,40.703561],[-73.913078,40.702422],[-73.910672,40.701072],[-73.910691,40.701054],[-73.91169,40.700055],[-73.911769,40.699975],[-73.904263,40.695683],[-73.905821,40.694114]]]]},"properties":{"area":"bushwick","origin_dat":"pediacities","borough":"BK","description":"Make the Road New York (MRNY) builds the power of Latino and working class communities to achieve dignity and justice through organizing, policy innovation, transformative education, and survival services.","email":"","full_address":"301 Grove Street  BK 11237","name":"Make The Road New York (Brooklyn)","org_id":31,"phone":"(718) 418-7690","service_area":"Bushwick","website_url":"http://www.maketheroad.org/","cartodb_id":44,"created_at":"2015-04-20T01:20:06Z","updated_at":"2015-04-20T01:20:06Z"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-73.980051,40.681861],[-73.9839,40.676148],[-73.988726,40.670342],[-73.989229,40.669748],[-73.992801,40.665527],[-73.995193,40.667025],[-73.997092,40.669267],[-73.99827,40.671153],[-73.99866,40.671705],[-73.998769,40.671602],[-73.99866,40.671705],[-73.99896,40.67218],[-73.99646,40.677457],[-73.994596,40.676572],[-73.98914,40.684595],[-73.988712,40.685224],[-73.980051,40.681861]]]]},"properties":{"area":"gowanus","origin_dat":"pediacities","borough":"BK","description":"Gowanus Canal Community Development Corporation of the Carroll Gardens area of Brooklyn was founded in 1979 to provide stable, healthy, and affordable living environments for low and moderate income households.

services for seniors. Northfield strives to improve the housing conditions in the community by meeting regularly with  residents to discuss the needs of the community.  Housing services include developing housing to create homeownership opportunities for low- and moderate-income residents who might otherwise be excluded from the housing market.  To that end the organization administers a HOME subsidy grant; purchases and rehabilitates currently dilapidated houses; provides homebuyer workshops and one on one counseling; and pursues opportunities to develop new affordable homeownership units.  We assist property owners who wish to make repairs to their homes by providing rehabilitation loan information.  The organization provides referrals to rental housing management companies and maintains a listing of rent regulated apartments in our area.

In this densely populated area with its slow vacancy rates, the services we provide are essential to our client population.","email":"zoeartemis@aol.com","full_address":"George T Douris Tower 27-40 Hoyt Ave Astoria, Ny 11102","name":"Northwest Queens Housing Corp.","org_id":116,"phone":"(718) 728-6886","service_area":"Astoria","website_url":"","cartodb_id":39,"created_at":"2015-04-20T01:20:06Z","updated_at":"2015-04-20T01:20:06Z"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-73.850078,40.740842],[-73.847779,40.740156],[-73.848852,40.738328],[-73.851571,40.737386],[-73.85339,40.736934],[-73.856492,40.736274],[-73.8585,40.735664],[-73.864424,40.733906],[-73.864427,40.733905],[-73.86563,40.733729],[-73.86663,40.734015],[-73.867915,40.733944],[-73.869199,40.733373],[-73.870813,40.732685],[-73.871344,40.731838],[-73.871341,40.730232],[-73.871429,40.729249],[-73.874196,40.727162],[-73.87698,40.725734],[-73.880478,40.724235],[-73.883048,40.723022],[-73.885641,40.722023],[-73.887018,40.723739],[-73.8872,40.728613],[-73.88756,40.730198],[-73.88806,40.730088],[-73.888523,40.734532],[-73.887702,40.734292],[-73.890157,40.739193],[-73.889742,40.739116],[-73.889898,40.740075],[-73.890212,40.74077],[-73.890547,40.741514],[-73.890875,40.743107],[-73.890716,40.743129],[-73.891095,40.745041],[-73.891457,40.746871],[-73.894338,40.746581],[-73.896938,40.750502],[-73.89728,40.750419],[-73.897699,40.752366],[-73.898697,40.754111],[-73.873641,40.756774],[-73.865056,40.757652],[-73.858269,40.757965],[-73.856058,40.758257],[-73.854633,40.758467],[-73.85376,40.757067],[-73.85219,40.75264],[-73.850742,40.750089],[-73.854396,40.748907],[-73.850078,40.740842]]]]},"properties":{"area":"Jackson Heights / Elmhurst / Corona","origin_dat":"pediacities","borough":"QN","description":"Neighborhood Housing Services of Northern Queens (NHSNQ) is a not-for-profit housing organization whose primary goal is to serve the housing needs of residents in Community Boards 1,2, 3 and 4.

concerned by the spread of deterioration from surrounding communities. Their goal was to stabilize, preserve, and upgrade the housing stock of Queens Community Board 5.  To insure neighborhood stability and improvement, GRRC provides the following services:  landlord/tenant counseling; identification and correction of in-rem/problem buildings, anti-graffiti cleaning program, and marketing of low-interest loans and grants.  All of our programs focus on neighborhood housing to stabilize and upgrade buildings and insure tenants live in well-maintained, affordable, and safe homes; that landlords get help to maintain and

HCC works collaboratively with a variety of neighborhood non-profits to better provide these services and to help residents access a wide range of social services.

Its original mission was to combat community deterioration, assist the community in meeting and solving its housing needs, and improve the living conditions for senior citizens, families of limited income, and other disadvantaged persons by sponsoring and promoting the renovation, rehabilitation, and tenant ownership of housing in the borough of Manhattan. Housing is planned, renovated or built with people as the first concern. Tenants are an integral part of the development and construction process. By putting people first, our staff creates affordable apartments which are well-maintained years after renovation. Many buildings have been converted to tenant ownership as low- and moderate-income coops. Ownership empowers tenants and builds a stable community.","email":"info@clintonhousing.org","full_address":"403 W 40th St New York, Ny 10018","name":"Clinton Housing Development Co.

By counseling individual tenants and organizing tenant associations, FDC helps to stabilize the parts of the neighborhood that are dense with apartment buildings. The organization works with low-to-moderate income owners of small homes, providing them with critical information on the importance of proper maintenance and financial planning, ensuring that they remain in their homes as strong, sound homeowners. FDC also reaches out to shareholders in the many troubled, over-leveraged co-operative apartment buildings in Flatbush and works with them to help stabilize management and financial operations of their buildings, explain rights and responsibilities, and teach home maintenance and repair courses. FDC also plays a role in the larger community; facilitating the overall growth and development of the Flatbush community by developing a 5-year strategic plan, in coordination with local residents and government officials to provide workshops, seminars and a regular newsletter about issues of concern to residents. In addition, FDC works to revitalize the area's commercial strips by advocating for filling of vacant commercial space, convincing new businesses to expand or relocate to Flatbush, and by convincing other businesses to remain by advocating on behalf of existing local businesses and working with local merchant associations to improve the business climate on retail strips.","email":"rredmond@fdconline.org","full_address":"1616 Newkirk Ave Brooklyn, Ny 11226","name":"Flatbush Development Corp.","org_id":81,"phone":"(718)

/ concourse village","origin_dat":"pediacities","borough":"BX","description":"The Mid-Bronx Senior Citizens Council, Inc. (MBSCC) continues to provide service required by residents of the community. MBSCC has identified the provision of quality job development/job placement as one of the greatest service needs of our residents. MBSCC's Job Resource Center has two full time employees and an additional Job/Business Development position was funded. As more community residents become employed, the need for child care service have greatly increased.  MBSCC has been able to increase child care service by securing funding from the Board of Education for the provision of Universal Pre-Kindergarten services to 80 children.  This program began in September of 1999.  Also four new day care classrooms have been completed that will house a total of 68 children.  Additional funding has been secured from the NYC Board of Education to provide Universal Pre-Kindergarten to serve 56 children. During the past three years,  MBSCC has involved community residents through it's Neighborhood Advisory Council (NAC) in negotiating with NYC Department of Design Construction for the construction of a community friendly Bronx Supreme Court building.  As a result of the negotiating, a High School of Law and Justice and a day care center for 140 children will be built adjacent to the new Supreme Court Building. The construction of the Family Preservation Center (FPC) at the Andrew Freedman Home is near completion.

Gigante. The mission of SEBCO is to provide both affordable housing and to improve the quality of life for the residents of Hunts Point. SEBCO works with urban planners and political leaders to develop schools, recreational facilities, and to redevelop the infrastructure, in order to pave the way for the reinvigoration of the neighborhood's housing stock. Through its development efforts, SEBCO has obtained extensive experience undertaking renovation and rehabilitation work in occupied multi-family buildings and is consistently recognized as one of New York City's top subsidized housing developers.  While the majority of the housing developed has been for low-income families, seniors and the formerly homeless, SEBCO also sponsors the construction and renovation of private houses, coops, and condos. As of June 2000, SEBCO has been involved in the creation of 63 apartment buildings and 358 private homes, coops, and condos. This represents a total of 2,991 housing units. Close to 3,000 families are living in permanent housing that SEBCO has developed over the past 32 years. SEBCO's focus is not limited to physical housing but in improving all aspects of the community. We provide over 130 hot meals in our Department for the Aging sponsored senior center; our computer learning center prepares community residents for the workplace. Over 2,000 residents receive our newsletter six times per year. Five after-school programs provide tutoring for over 80 children. Another social service mission of SEBCO Development is to provide quality transitional housing for homeless families. SEBCO operates two TIER II shelters composed of 96 units for New York City Department of Homeless Services. An important goal is not only providing temporary housing for the homeless, but locating quality permanent housing and preparing families for that important next step.","email":"jcalderone@sebcodevelopment.org","full_address":"885 Bruckner Blvd Bronx, Ny 10459","name":"South East Bronx Community Development Corp.","org_id":56,"phone":"(718) 617-2800","service_area":"Hunts Point/Aldus/Longwood","website_url":"http://www.sebcodevelopment.org","cartodb_id":77,"created_at":"2015-04-20T01:20:06Z","updated_at":"2015-04-20T01:20:06Z"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-73.896937,40.834361],[-73.896302,40.833544],[-73.895274,40.834035],[-73.894692,40.83062],[-73.897002,40.828051],[-73.899797,40.827686],[-73.903461,40.828534],[-73.903852,40.828195],[-73.90509,40.829015],[-73.907647,40.826696],[-73.90941,40.822869],[-73.916309,40.824904],[-73.910307,40.828774],[-73.90896,40.830227],[-73.907069,40.833437],[-73.90343,40.832217],[-73.901212,40.835499],[-73.896937,40.834361]]]]},"properties":{"area":"morrisania","origin_dat":"pediacities","borough":"BX","description":"Bronx Shepherds Restoration Corporation (BSRC) was organized 23 years ago by pastors and lay persons who chose to remain in the South Bronx after major institutions had abandoned the area.  A major thrust of the organization has been the upgrading of existing housing through rehabilitation or new construction. BSRC owns and manages 340 E. 184 St., a 64 unit building, a 46 unit building at 1590 E. 172 St. and an 8 unit building at 942 Leggett Avenue.  They have also sponsored 139 new 2-3 family homes and 267 units of condominium housing; rehabilitated over 140 units of low-income affordable housing; gut rehabilitated 69 units, currently 100% occupied; and have been selected to gut rehabilitate 2 buildings at 932 E 173 St and 937 E 172 St, a total of 48 units.  Under the Neighborhood Small Homes Program, BSRC will rehabilitate 12 1-3 family homes and then sell them to community residents.  A new frail and elderly building located at 171 St. and Park Avenue has been accepting residents since September, 2002.  BSRC is a community consultant in Community Board # 3 for the HPD Anti-Abandonment Program and has retrofitted their building at 1932 Washington Ave. to include use for additional community space.  Bronx Shepherds continues to organize tenants associations and security patrols and provide orientation for all tenants as well as assisting with social services as needed.  A community survey with UDAP of Columbia University will be used to plan additional housing and commercial revitalization.","email":"info@bronxshepherds.org","full_address":"1590 E 172nd St Bronx, Ny 10472","name":"Bronx Shepherds Restoration Corp.","org_id":54,"phone":"(718) 299-0500","service_area":"Morrisania","website_url":"http://www.bronxshepherds.org","cartodb_id":79,"created_at":"2015-04-20T01:20:06Z","updated_at":"2015-04-20T01:20:06Z"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-73.802909,40.886031],[-73.794055,40.883701],[-73.794471,40.883077],[-73.796153,40.883474],[-73.798153,40.884227],[-73.798375,40.884092],[-73.799381,40.884355],[-73.803272,40.885431],[-73.805141,40.886018],[-73.807578,40.885774],[-73.81254,40.886658],[-73.814467,40.886792],[-73.816091,40.886615],[-73.820315,40.88552],[-73.820081,40.883754],[-73.821489,40.878397],[-73.823297,40.874445],[-73.823167,40.869919],[-73.821581,40.868746],[-73.821225,40.869043],[-73.820814,40.868792],[-73.821123,40.868521],[-73.820146,40.867736],[-73.81954,40.865447],[-73.81984,40.862759],[-73.819016,40.862272],[-73.820631,40.86134],[-73.827098,40.859074],[-73.830091,40.858151],[-73.836463,40.856193],[-73.843753,40.857185],[-73.846551,40.857524],[-73.849335,40.857588],[-73.857112,40.857037],[-73.856389,40.857594],[-73.868882,40.857224],[-73.868318,40.857863],[-73.869554,40.857785],[-73.871025,40.85731],[-73.870481,40.865414],[-73.870555,40.869703],[-73.870296,40.87535],[-73.870285,40.876103],[-73.869398,40.878113],[-73.870072,40.878301],[-73.869286,40.880249],[-73.8662,40.887141],[-73.86088,40.896553],[-73.861113,40.89759],[-73.85926,40.900338],[-73.859468,40.900518],[-73.859216,40.900834],[-73.859077,40.901008],[-73.859236,40.901099],[-73.85942,40.901394],[-73.859377,40.901566],[-73.859206,40.901548],[-73.859027,40.901445],[-73.858864,40.901712],[-73.859362,40.901897],[-73.859464,40.901934],[-73.859489,40.902044],[-73.859529,40.902223],[-73.859579,40.902441],[-73.859264,40.90267],[-73.859105,40.902645],[-73.858734,40.902293],[-73.858728,40.902289],[-73.858726,40.902289],[-73.858401,40.902214],[-73.85816,40.902306],[-73.858162,40.902399],[-73.858165,40.902596],[-73.857969,40.902851],[-73.857952,40.902854],[-73.857748,40.902788],[-73.85756,40.902918],[-73.857111,40.90365],[-73.857172,40.904083],[-73.857056,40.904405],[-73.856992,40.904585],[-73.857102,40.904709],[-73.857186,40.904692],[-73.857359,40.904731],[-73.857435,40.904842],[-73.857371,40.904952],[-73.857178,40.905287],[-73.85705,40.905292],[-73.856654,40.905055],[-73.856361,40.905103],[-73.85601,40.905306],[-73.856012,40.905483],[-73.856355,40.905529],[-73.856503,40.905564],[-73.856924,40.905975],[-73.85681,40.906156],[-73.856557,40.906262],[-73.855956,40.906219],[-73.855805,40.906265],[-73.855527,40.906381],[-73.855138,40.906867],[-73.854238,40.907033],[-73.85381,40.907684],[-73.853741,40.907788],[-73.853834,40.907975],[-73.854229,40.908019],[-73.854711,40.908007],[-73.854911,40.908355],[-73.854589,40.90894],[-73.853917,40.909466],[-73.853601,40.909607],[-73.853354,40.910044],[-73.852956,40.910354],[-73.85277,40.910406],[-73.852585,40.910311],[-73.85266,40.910016],[-73.852457,40.909861],[-73.852275,40.909855],[-73.851783,40.910161],[-73.851492,40.910272],[-73.851448,40.91045],[-73.851071,40.910372],[-73.853475,40.907531],[-73.853475,40.907531],[-73.850921,40.906617],[-73.850173,40.907508],[-73.847226,40.906221],[-73.844819,40.90553],[-73.844893,40.904191],[-73.841387,40.904173],[-73.841063,40.903215],[-73.84102,40.902815],[-73.84068,40.901518],[-73.840045,40.900575],[-73.839246,40.899502],[-73.839217,40.899427],[-73.839195,40.899351],[-73.839178,40.899274],[-73.839168,40.899197],[-73.839164,40.899119],[-73.839166,40.899042],[-73.839174,40.898964],[-73.839189,40.898887],[-73.839209,40.898816],[-73.839236,40.898736],[-73.839664,40.897886],[-73.839648,40.897331],[-73.838392,40.894068],[-73.838043,40.894143],[-73.830932,40.892197],[-73.822677,40.88962],[-73.822486,40.890099],[-73.823265,40.889988],[-73.823366,40.891076],[-73.822853,40.891207],[-73.820495,40.89058],[-73.816017,40.889324],[-73.802909,40.886031]],[[-73.853637,40.873301],[-73.85555,40.871814],[-73.853598,40.873289],[-73.853637,40.873301]]]]},"properties":{"area":"northeast bronx","origin_dat":"pediacities","borough":"BX","description":"Neighborhood Initiatives Development Corporation (N.I.D.C.) is a non-profit organization that was formed in 1982 to stabilize the neighborhoods within Bronx Community Board 11 and to ensure the provision of safe, decent, affordable housing for low to moderate income residents.

The NWBCCC was formed in 1984. The chief services provided by the Coalition and its affiliates are organizing assistance to parents of school children, tenants, community residents through our Safe Streets program, and to students through the Youth Program.  NWBCCC works on area-wide campaigns that benefit the community.  Combating school overcrowding is our most important such campaign at the moment.  The Education Committee's work contributed to the opening of seven new school buildings last fall.  Other current activities include working to keep the North Central Bronx Hospital from reducing its services or even closing; fighting the location of the federally mandated water filtration plant in Van Cortlandt Park; and working for the implementation of \"community policing\"\" in cooperation with the police leadership in the Northwest

Brooklyn Development Corporation (NBDC), was organized in 1979 by civic and business leaders of Greenpoint for the purpose of promoting neighborhood stability, improving economic climate in the community, and building affordable housing. Guided by this mission and a firm understanding of Greenpoint's needs and character, NBDC has developed a strategy that includes programs in housing development and preservation, commercial and industrial development, and employment and education. NBDC has leveraged millions of dollars of public and private funds; it has worked successfully to establish public-private partnerships in community development; and has cooperated with other community groups and organizations who work to meet similar goals in Greenpoint. The purpose of NBDC's housing program is twofold: to preserve the existing housing stock and promote a stable and invested citizenry in Greenpoint and to develop affordable housing for the area's lowest income residents and through thus induce economic development. The former is achieved through the on-going services for homeowners and tenants that includes securing low-interest property rehabilitation loans; rent regulation education; property management and maintenance; landlord/tenant disputes; affordable housing referrals; and securing other housing entitlements. The latter is addressed by constantly looking for sites and means for developing new affordable housing units for the most needy residents. NBDC has also invested heavily into educating Greenpoint's youngsters. Annual After School Programs are run in five local schools providing warm and structured environment for over 450 children with supplemental tutoring in math and reading, arts& crafts workshops, sports and active recreation. NBDC's Community Achievement Project in Schools (CAPS) confronts truancy in schools, improves students' attendance and develops a closer level of communication between schools and families.

(CGA) was incorporated as a not-for-profit organization to assist the disadvantaged regardless of race or religion and to create a spirit of community. The new not-for-profit began by leveraging federal and state funds into the community and developing service programs in education, cultural awareness, employment counseling and job placement. CGA has developed programs that have addressed the needs of the working class neighborhoods of South Brooklyn. Programs benefitting low- and moderate-income individuals and families include landlord/tenant counseling and assistance in filing applications for assisted housing (Section 8 and Housing Authority.) CGA offers assistance and technical services to small property owners and rehabilitation funds for property management. When Carroll Gardens began experiencing its first wave of gentrification, they began to explore the need for affordable housing to ease displacement of long time residents because of exorbitant rent increases. CGA is the recipient of two John Heinz Neighborhood Demonstration Program Awards totaling $125,000. This award has a highly competitive application process and is funded through HUD.
